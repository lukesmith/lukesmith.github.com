What are Sony playing at?</p>
<p>
<em>Taking a page from Microsoft's launch, the PS3 will support a hard drive, but<br />
it may be something you have to buy seperately. To make matters much, much, much,<br />
insanely worse, the 60 GB hard drive will be REQUIRED to play games. That's right,<br />
you may be able to buy a PS3 that doesn't actually play games. Go figure.</em></p>
<p>
So if this is true, and the only other reason for having a PS3 is for its media capability,<br />
you would be buying a big box of the latest technology and not be able to make the<br />
most of it.</p>
