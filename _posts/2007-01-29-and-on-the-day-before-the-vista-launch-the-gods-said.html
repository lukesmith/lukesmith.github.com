The screens gone. I either get red lines, as seen above, or blue lines (when the background<br />
is white). The great thing tho is if I move a Aero Glass window over a screwed up<br />
area it looks perfect :) glass rocks. Now how to turn the whole screen to be glass?</p>
<p>
Oh well, I'll have to contact toshiba tomorrow about getting it fixed. Luckily it's<br />
under warranty still (fingers crossed).</p>
<p>
So I've been using Vista RTM for 2months now and on the day its released to the hordes<br />
I have to stop using it. I hope it's not going to take 2 months to get it fixed. I<br />
can't deal with XP no more :(</p>
