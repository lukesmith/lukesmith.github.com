<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> have now removed banners from their browser.<br />
I expect more people will begin to use Opera now they don't have to pay for it. I<br />
got myself a registration code a few weeks ago when they were giving them out to get<br />
rid of the adverts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Several people I know love Opera, despite the adverts (they just crack it) but hate<br />
MSN Messenger because of the adverts. So should MSN make you pay for the application<br />
to get rid of the adverts? These people can then go find a crack and be happy. But<br />
I expect with their current reason for hateing it gone they will find a new one.</p>
