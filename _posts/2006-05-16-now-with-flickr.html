<p>I just signed up for flickr, considering I'm into the latest technology it's taken<br />
me a while to click that 'sign up' button. I've worked on my own photo gallery recently<br />
which I will work on a bit more in the future but for now I'm going to use flickr.</p>
<p>The photos of my recent ski trip to Les Deux Alpes in the south of France. The most<br />
beautiful resort I've been to so far with awesome snow considering it was the end<br />
of the season.<br />
