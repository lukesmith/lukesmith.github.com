<p>I've splashed out on another extravagent product, a perk of no longer<br />
being a student. In our house we have a home entertainment system in<br />
the works; PS2, Xbox, PC (not MCE yet), hifi and a small 14inch tv -<br />
not what you want to be watching your movies on, or even playing Xbox<br />
360 games on (when it arrives). So i cut a deal with my housemates<br />
which means I can get a new TV for all of our viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>I was originally looking at getting a Samsung 26inch LCD, which is<br />
showing off the Xbox360 consoles in all the highstreet stores, but came<br />
across the LG 32LX2R 32 inch LCD which is cheaper than the 32 inch version of the<br />
26 inch Samsung I was originally looking at.</p>

<p>
Bring on Thursday when it arrives...and hopefully the Xbox 360 won't be far behind<br />
it.</p>
