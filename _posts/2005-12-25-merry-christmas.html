Dinner eaten, presents opened, rubbish on the tele and Christmas Eve hangover gone.<br />
Ahh the fun the is christmas day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Got my tablet pc ram upgraded, I now have 1.5gb which is more than my desktop. Ahh<br />
the simplicity of buying for a geek.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Enjoy the rest of the day and don't drink too much (it took me 5minutes to get in<br />
the front door last night apparently :s)</p>

Merry Christmas</p>
