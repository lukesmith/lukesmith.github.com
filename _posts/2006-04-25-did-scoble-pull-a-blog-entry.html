I got a feed update in feeddemon and one was scobles titled 'The $100 million decision'.<br />
I thought it was worthy of a forward toÂ a friend to see what he thinks (after<br />
all he hates the adverts) but upon going to the post <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/04/25/the-100-million-decision/">entry</a> the<br />
message 'Sorry, no posts matched your criteria'. Does this mean he's pulled it due<br />
to higher powers that be and I just happened to grab the feed while it was available?</p>
<p>
Going to his front <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">blog</a> page also has<br />
the post magically gone.</p>
