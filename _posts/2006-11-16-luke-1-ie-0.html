I've been spending the day trying to track down an annoying bug in IE to do with javascript,<br />
"Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site http://....", "operation aborted".<br />
It's all to do with the google maps api I'm working with. It works fine under firefox<br />
yet I couldn't get the dam thing to work in IE7 (not tried IE6 yet).</p>
<p>
The problem was the javascript I wrote was modifying parts of the page before they<br />
were rendered and IE threw a benny, a simple defer="defer" attribute in the &lt;script<br />
type="text/javascript"&gt; tag fixes the problem.</p>
