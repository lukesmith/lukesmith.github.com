O2 now have the <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/shop/o2uk/jsp/handset/ViewHandset.do?menu=y&amp;prodID=consumer:O2:XDAExec:Online500:Package">XDA<br />
Exec </a>for sale, i choked on my crisps when i saw the price. Â£139.99! with a 18month<br />
contract at Â£35 a month (i currently fork out around Â£30 a month). So I will be changing<br />
from the old school genie contract to this one, get more minutes and txts and a new<br />
brick to play with :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Only the fools at O2 no-longer have me authorised on the account to make any changes<br />
so couldn't splash out now.</p>
