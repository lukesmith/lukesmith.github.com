<p>
Just checked my play account and the status of my Xbox360 order has been<br />
<br />
changed from 'Awaiting Stock' to 'Order Placed'. So either they have finally got<br />
<br />
around to placing my order, or have placed an order with their supplier - the Stock<br />
Status doesn't have information on this one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe i'll be able to play that game I've had for the last month soon.</p>
