I spent the whole of saturday <a href="http://www.paintballgames.co.uk/">paintballing</a>.<br />
Apart from suffering from aching legs and the required bruises paintballings such<br />
a cool sport, although very expensive.</p>
<p>
Over in the states some geeks are organising what can only be described as the greatest<br />
paintballing weekend ever. Paintballing + Geeks = <a href="http://www.techwars.ca/">Techwars</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>It is a 50 acre, 100 man, 2 day paintball battle of high-tech soldiers combating<br />
in the unrelenting Maritime wilderness. Each army will utilize any technological means<br />
necessary to help gain an advantage including breaching the security of the enemy<br />
technology. Knowledge, IT, and security are the keys to winning the war.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The problem with paintballing normally (as I did) is the games last only about 10minutes<br />
and the arenas are pretty small. It also ends up as a free for all within your teams<br />
with noone organising tactics or having time to decide tactics.</p>
<p>
I hope someone organises a UK version of <a href="http://www.techwars.ca/">Techwars</a>!</p>
