<p>If you can't wait for the O2 XDA Exec (i-Mate JasJar/HTC Universal) then look no further than <a href="http://www.expansys.com/product.asp?code=119353">expansys</a>.<br />
If your willing to fork out over the top GBP then go for it. Me? Well i'm waiting<br />
for o2 to release it in a few weeks *fingers crossed*, hopefully getting it for a<br />
nice upgrade price :) <img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=13" /></p>
