Well I'm a lover of marmite, and now it's to also be sold in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/food/Story/0,,1729616,00.html">squeezable<br />
bottles</a>. In order to make it squeezable tho they are going to be changing the<br />
thickness. They claim it won't change it's taste but we know nothing taste the same<br />
when they claim it will :(</p>
