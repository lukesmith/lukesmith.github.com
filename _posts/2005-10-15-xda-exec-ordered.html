I just ordered the XDA Exec from o2. Those guys are useless sometimes. Be warned when<br />
phoning them to upgrade your phones, check online and see how much a new customer<br />
can get it for. In my case a new customer can get the phone for Â£140 when my upgrade<br />
price was Â£220. So much for them looking after their existing customers, I've been<br />
with them for 5years and thats how they treat me :o luckily after I pointed this out<br />
they let me have it for the cheaper price.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The good thing is I upgrade my contract to an 18month one, I can't buy the latest<br />
one in 12months time now which will keep the wallet happy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Now to sell my body so I can pay for it.</p>
