As everyone knows Eurovision is all about political voting and not the 'awesome' talent<br />
of the individuals singing. So this year the UK have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4774670.stm">voted</a> one<br />
of the stupidest songs ever to represent us. The song is so bad and tacky it makes<br />
it win worthy for the circus of Eurovision.</p>
<p>
I even txt in and voted for it! (and not because of the 5 schoolgirls). Check out<br />
the song over on Daz Sampson's <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dazsampson">myspace</a>.<br />
No video tho :(</p>
