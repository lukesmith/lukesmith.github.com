Theres <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4723390.stm">lots</a> of <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2006/02/20060216234239.shtml">news</a> about<br />
a virus/trojan for OS X 10.4. Sure it needs user interaction to install itself, but<br />
the point being Mac boys can't say go around saying they have a secure virus/trojan<br />
(whichever it finally gets classified as) free operating system.</p>
<p>
One thing to notice is that <em>'...most users were <b>not prompted</b> for the administrator<br />
password before the file modifications took place.' </em>So if you're running with<br />
admin priveleges go create a new user without them.</p>
<p>
Better yet wait until <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1925239,00.asp">Apple<br />
dumps OS X and Adopt Windows</a></p>
