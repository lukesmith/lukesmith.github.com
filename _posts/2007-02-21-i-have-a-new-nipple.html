<p>
I must say I am extremly impressed with the speed at which my tablet got fixed and<br />
returned (in less pieces than it was sent to them in).</p>
<p>
I'd heard stories of people not having their laptops returned from Toshiba for several<br />
weeks/months but my experience says otherwise. The screen has been replaced so the<br />
red lines have gone, and so have the dead pixels I once had. They also kindly replaced<br />
the keyboard as the down cursor key had fallen off, which means I now have a new nipple<br />
to caress with my index finger.</p>
<p>
So back to Vista &lt;3</p>
