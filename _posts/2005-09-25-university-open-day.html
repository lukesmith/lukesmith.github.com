<p>I cycled :o upto campus yesterday to the <a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/">University<br />
of Reading</a> open day. Spent the afternoon in the Madlab, where <a href="http://www.etingley.com/">Tingley</a> was<br />
helping out demoing some of the mobile robots with Ben Hutt. It was 4years ago I went<br />
to the open day, and 3years ago today I started University as a fresher,<br />
happy anniversary Owenkins! Time flies :( Nevermind, freshers week this week and I'm<br />
off to St Patricks hall bar tonight, not to perve on the freshers, but the <a href="http://www.blueroosters.co.uk/">Blue<br />
Roosters</a> (tingley's band) are playing.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=37" /></p>
