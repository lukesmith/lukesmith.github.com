<p>My blogs been without a subtitle for as long as I can remember, I just couldn’t think of anything “catchy”. But now I have come up with something that I think fits “Write today. Wrong tomorrow”.</p>
<p>This refers to the constant learning that occurs in the development world. I’m a huge believer that if you look back at code written 6 months ago and think “wow, that was amazing – I wouldn’t do anything differently” then you haven’t learnt anything new since.</p>
<p>So take whatever I say on this blog with a pinch of salt, I might not necessarily agree with it in 6 months time – that includes the subtitle ;)</p>
