<p>I just finished watching the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/executives/billgates.mspx">keynote</a><br />
<br />
by Bill Gates at the Consumer Electronic Show. The iHD capability of<br />
HD-DVD is awesome, being able to find information out about the actors<br />
in a certain scene while still viewing the movie is a great feature<br />
also being able to create a managed legal copy of the disk on your pc<br />
(also available in <a href="http://www.blu-ray.com">blu-ray</a>).</p>
<p>One thing I don't get, with the world is going HD and broadband<br />
catching on like wildfire (especially with the kind of people who watch<br />
these keynote speeches), then why don't they make available a higher<br />
quality stream than 300k</p>
