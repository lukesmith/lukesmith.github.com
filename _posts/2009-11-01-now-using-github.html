<p />
<p>I've decided to move my open source projects over to <a href="http://github.com/lukesmith">github</a>, rather than hosting them on a private subversion server where they arenâ€™t very accessible.</p>
<p>From what I've seen, and heard, github is a great source control repository, I only hope there is a visual studio addin as good as visualsvn in the pipeline.    </p>
<p>Currently my 2 JavaScript libraries have been moved over</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/lukesmith/linq2js">linq2js</a> is a JavaScript library providing an api similar to that of linq in the .net framework. It features a near complete method for method implementation of those found on the IEnumerable interface as well as lazy evaluation of queries. </li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/lukesmith/vegeojson">vegeojson</a> is a helper utility i wrote for drawing shapes on a virtual earth (now bing) map given an object in the <a href="http://geojson.org/">geojson</a> format. </li>
</ul>
