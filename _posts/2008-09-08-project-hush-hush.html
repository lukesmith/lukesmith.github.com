<p>I came up with a lightening bolt of an idea the other week while I was thinking of a small project to do to try out some new technology. This project has spiraled into a bigger project which I think could be quite cool and big - so there goes my evenings for the next few months.</p>
<p>The few people I've told the idea to seem to think it also sounds good, either that or they're just humouring me so I waste my time on it. Either way it's giving me a great chance to try out some technologies that interest me.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/sdk">Microsoft Virtual Earth</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC Framework</a> - no more WebForms! :)</li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> - extremely powerful JavaScript library, I've only scratched the surface so far</li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/overview.aspx">Microsoft SQL Server 2008</a> - Only really for the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/spatial-data.aspx">spatial features</a>, but I've noticed some other cool features like passing tables as a parameter to UDFs</li>
<li><a href="http://silverlight.net/default.aspx">Silverlight</a> - I've not started working with this yet, but it's on the todo list (in my head) to use</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully it will encourage me to blog more, I'll be sharing bits and pieces as I go along.</p>
<p>I discovered a free <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> source control provider (<a href="http://www.assembla.com/">assembla</a>) so all my work is safely backed up remotely (maybe I should use the project management tools to keep a track of ideas). Ideally I'd like to do host the source control myself, only currently I can't afford to change (or find one that matches (will match) my needs) hosting provider to a Virtual Private Server.</p>
