<p>I called up O2 yesterday to enquire about the XDA Exec, they said they don't know the release date but quite possibly next week. Someone else told me that on their contract, Â£20 a month, when they enquired about it they were told they could upgrade for Â£220, quite a difference from the Â£399 heard elsewhere. Only time will tell how much I can get it for, if its near the Â£200 mark i'm alot more likely to upgrade straight away. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=52" /></p>
