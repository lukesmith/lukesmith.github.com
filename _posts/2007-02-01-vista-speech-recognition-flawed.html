I'm sure by now you've <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6320865.stm">heard</a> about<br />
the Speech Recognition <a href="http://bink.nu/Article9441.bink">flaw</a> in Windows<br />
Vista (my mom knew about it before me...my excuse is I was busy working all day and<br />
didn't have time to catch up on the news). The one that if a dodgy mp3 played on your<br />
PC it could delete files. Here's how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Record a voice clip of yourself saying 'start listening' followed by 'delete everything'<br />
(im unsure on the exact voice commands).</li>
<li>
Send the recorded mp3 to a friend saying 'Lolz0r, l1st3n 2 d1s'.</li>
<li>
Hope they have a microphone.</li>
<li>
Hope they have a set of speakers.</li>
<li>
Hope the speakers aren't muted in the Sound Mixer.</li>
<li>
Hope the microphone isn't muted in the SoundMixer.</li>
<li>
Hope the speakers are turned on and set at an adequate volume.</li>
<li>
Hope they have Speech Recognition turn on and configured.</li>
<li>
Hope their microphone is close enough to their speakers to be able to pick up on the<br />
sound properly.</li>
<li>
Hope their microphone isn't too close to the speakers for their to be horrible feedback.</li>
<li>
Hope the person you send it to is deaf so they don't hear the sound of your voice<br />
with commands coming out of their speakers.</li>
<li>
Hope the person is blind so they don't see speech recognition is accepting commands.</li>
<li>
And finally hope speech recognition actually picks up your commands successfully in<br />
sequence. If it doesn't hear 'start listening' as the first one to tell it to listen<br />
for commands then I'm afraid it's not going to process them.</li>
</ol>
<p>
As you can see it's very easy to accomplish so we should all be turning off our speakers<br />
and unplugging our microphones and putting tin foil hats on our heads. And if it is<br />
accomplishable (and some people have tried and tested it with successful results)<br />
doesn't that just goto show how good Windows Vista Speech Recognition is?</p>

On another note:</p>
<p>
BBC's technology news coverage is a complete joke. They have a video explaining the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6310000/newsid_6311800/6311899.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm">upgrade<br />
process</a> and make it sound like upgrading from XP is a real chore. 'Lets upgrade...oh<br />
wait it won't let me continue...i have to go back and uninstall the virus checker<br />
software...i start again...no more troubles...and its installed within 2 hours from<br />
when i first started', bearing in mind it took 25minutes to uninstall shitty Norton.</p>
<p>
They don't say 'oh look, it cant continue but its very helpful and points me in the<br />
right direction at what I need to do, after that there are no problems and it installs<br />
effortlessly'. So what are the 'unpredictable pitfalls' of upgrading. From the video<br />
it seems there are non, since Vista points out the problems when you start and how<br />
to resolve them. I'm not an English student but isn't this classed as predicting?</p>
