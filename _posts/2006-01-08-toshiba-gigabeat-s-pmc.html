<p>14 months ago I purchased a Creative Zen PMC, well 2, the first had a<br />
HDD failure so had to be returned....oh and the 2nd one did too. I now<br />
don't have a PMC, but Toshiba have a sleek and powerful device coming<br />
out February/March that shall be taking pride of place in my pocket at<br />
some point - The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/media/gigabeat.mspx">Toshiba<br />
Gigabeat S</a>. And this thing will actually fit inside my pocket!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/01/07/video-feature-toshibas-gigabeat-s/">Engadget</a> has<br />
a short video of the device</p>
