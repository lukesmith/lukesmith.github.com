Ok my puns are extremely bad but fire up your favorite web browser and mosey on over<br />
to these links to get lots of bits (oh theres another one).</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/getthebeta.mspx">Office 2007<br />
Beta 2</a> - Awesome, I've already found out how to do citations properly from playing<br />
around. Everything is much easier to find thanks to the ribbon. And the Theming is<br />
excellent<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/downloads/products/getthebeta/#runWinFXApps">WinFX<br />
Beta 2 Components</a> (with Go-Live license) - If you're a developer and want to get<br />
to grips with WinFX grab the WinFX components here, if you're not a developer I still<br />
recommend downloading the WinFX runtime so you can play with the juicy apps that developers<br />
make with this new technology.</p>
<p>
Stay tuned for Vista Beta 2, <a href="http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=6320">coming<br />
in June</a>, for public download. I'll be installing it tonight on my tablet, and<br />
Dave!</p>
<p>
Also some new CTP goodies are out<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/interactive_designer/id_free_trial.aspx">Expression<br />
Interactive Designer May CTP</a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/graphic_designer/gd_free_trial.aspx">Expression<br />
Graphic Designer May CTP</a></p>
<p>
If you don't like Microsoft and their products, go download them anyway. Just think<br />
you're be costing the big M$ bandwidth, and once they're downloaded you might as well<br />
give them a go yea?</p>
