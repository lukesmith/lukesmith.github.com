I just had a sudden brain wave. I've been going through my code library at work tidying<br />
stuff up and marking some methods as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.obsoleteattribute.aspx">Obsolete</a>,<br />
but the thing about this is that it leaves obsolete methods in the classes cs file...yukky.<br />
So my brain wave is to make use of <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wa80x488.aspx">partial<br />
classes</a> and move all obsolete methods out of the main class cs file and into a<br />
myclass.obsolete.cs file.</p>
