Got my bag almost packed ready for the long trip to <a href="http://www.valthorens.com/">Val<br />
Thorens</a> in the south of France for a week of sun, snow and skiing. Even tho im<br />
only going for a week I have my gadgets prepared; Canon IXUS 500 digital camera, which<br />
im hoping won't have its LCD smashed this year, <a href="http://www.snowandrock.com/shop/activity/ski/accessories/two_way_radios_walkie_talkie/products/EMXBS.htm">Motorla<br />
T5622</a> two way radios and my trusty XDA Exec with a 1gb SD card full of music,<br />
which will hopefully last the lengthy coach journey.</p>
<p></p>

Mum don't send me lots of joke emails while im away or your block my inbox up.</p>
