Just over 2 years after I dreamed up Ambulex, which then evolved into Saviour, it<br />
has now been created by another company. The whole idea of equipping paramedics with<br />
PDAs, allowing them to keep in contact with the command center while in the Ambulance<br />
as well as away from the ambulance. The whole thing was dreamed up one day by me and<br />
brought to life with the rest of Team Babbage during the Imagine Cup 2004.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Everything in their product mentioned in the <a href="http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/wifi-ambulance-just-ta-connect-ya-140097.php">article</a> was<br />
part of Ambulex. How long until they expand it to become Saviour?</p>
