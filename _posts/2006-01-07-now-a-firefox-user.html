<p>Since installing the Community Server 2 beta I've been having a few<br />
problems posting entries from IE7, get javascript errors when I click<br />
'post' but it works fine in FireFox. When I'm logged in as admin in IE7<br />
it works fine, and it used to work when logged in as lukesmith, but<br />
then suddenly stopped the other day. Though CS2 beta isn't 100% FireFox<br />
friendly either, errors occur in the odd place where they don't in IE.</p>
