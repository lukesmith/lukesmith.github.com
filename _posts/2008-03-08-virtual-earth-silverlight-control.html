I questioned in my last <a href="http://blog.lukesmith.net/2008/03/06/DeepZoomAndVirtualEarth.aspx">post</a> I<br />
wondered how long it would be until a Virtual Earth Silverlight 2.0 Control was released<br />
using the Deep Zoom technology. The answer? Well it's not going to be too long a wait.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>I also showed a preview of the new Virtual Earth Map Control built with </em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/"><em>Silverlight<br />
2.0</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://labs.live.com/seadragon"><em>SeaDragon</em></a><em> (aka<br />
Deep Zoom) technology. The application had media incorporated into the map control<br />
such as pictures and video - both of which scaled as I zoomed the map in and out.<br />
They also allowed for Deep Zoom into the photos. The new map control will be available<br />
soon. </em></p>
