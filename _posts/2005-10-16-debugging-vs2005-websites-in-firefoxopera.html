When I first got hold of Visual Studio 2005 beta2 and created a webapp I tried copying<br />
the built in webservers url to firefox and opera to see how the thing rendered, which<br />
never worked. And I only figured this out today.</p>
<p></p>
<ol></p>
<li>
Select the property pages of the website in the solution explorer then select 'Start<br />
Options'<br />

</li>
<li>
under the 'Server' section uncheck 'NTLM Authentication'</li>
<p>&gt;<br /></p>
<p>
Now instead of needing to upload your website to your server you can do it locally.</p>
