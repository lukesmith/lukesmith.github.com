<p>Well today it arrived, a brand new 32inch LCD Tv with HD Ready and its such a beauty.</p>
<p>With plenty of connections; 2 Scart, S-Video, DVI, 2 Composite, HDMI +<br />
another one I've never heard of theres enough to have the PC (2 if<br />
connecting using my KVM), PS2, Xbox, Xbox360 (when it arrives), NTL box<br />
and DVD player connected at one time.</p>
<p>We're still tweaking the picture quality for terrestrial signals,<br />
almost looking beautiful. The HD movies from the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers">apple</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/HDVideo.aspx">windowsmedia</a><br />
<br />
websites look awesome, only the PC running them is a bit weak so they<br />
suffer a bit of jerkyness.</p>
