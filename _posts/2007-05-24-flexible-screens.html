This is some <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/loled/sony-flexi+oled-screen-is-trouble-waiting-to-happen-263366.php">cool<br />
technology</a>, flexible OLED screens that or 0.3mm thick.</p>
<p>
The London Underground has LCD screens on the elevators down at some stations, I've<br />
been saying the larger advertisements on the platforms will be changed when<br />
the technology is feasible.</p>
<p>
This will bring targetted advertisements depending on the time of day, and whats happening<br />
in London. Even have the latest news scrolling along the bottom/top. That to me is<br />
better than a static advert which remains for weeks on end.</p>
