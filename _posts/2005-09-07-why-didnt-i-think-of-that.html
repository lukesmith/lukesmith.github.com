Don't you hate it when you hear of something someone's done and think to yourself<br />
"why didn't I think of that?"?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Why couldn't I have thought of:<br />
Those little bags you put your washing tablets in which somehow stops your clothes<br />
getting white power marks on them.<br />
The wheel - imagine if patents were around back then.<br />
Patents, imagine inventing the idea of patents and then patenting it.<br />
The solar powered torch. But this idea is something thats in my glasp, something I<br />
could have actually created.</p>
