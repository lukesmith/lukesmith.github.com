I've been getting 'Unexpected error 0x8ffe2740 occurred' under IIS 5.1 when trying<br />
to start the website today and just went about fixing it. A quick <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=iis+Unexpected+error+0x8ffe2740+occurred&amp;meta=">google</a> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816944">discovered</a> that<br />
it's due to another application using port 80. I remember having this problem once<br />
before and the culprit was <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>. Closing down<br />
Skype sorts out the problem.</p>
<p>
This <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2005/09/20/425693.aspx">post</a> explains<br />
how to stop Skype from using port 80 if its free.</p>
