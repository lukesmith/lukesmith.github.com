I've been getting shitloads of traffic to my blog lately from <a href="http://search.msn.com/">msn<br />
search</a>. Last year I <a href="http://blog.lukesmith.net/PermaLink,guid,100.aspx">blogged</a> about<br />
'superbowl sunday', and since that time of year must be almost upon us (i have no<br />
idea when it is) people must be googling for it.</p>
<p>
It turns out its because everytime I get a visit to my blog, the referreral webpage<br />
is logged and listed. After the first person searched for <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=Superbowl+Sunday+2007&amp;FORM=QSRE5">Superbowl<br />
sunday 2007</a> it got listed. The search engine picked up on this and boosted me<br />
higher in their list which caused more people to see my post and those referral links<br />
to be stored.</p>
<p>
As a result I am now higher up the msn search ranking than <a href="http://www.superbowl.com/playoffs/schedule">superbowl.com</a> for<br />
the <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=Superbowl+Sunday+2007&amp;FORM=QSRE5">search<br />
term</a>.</p>
<p>
So I apologise to anyone looking here for info on this years Superbowl, I know nothing about<br />
it apart from it sucks compared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_%28soccer%29">proper<br />
football</a>.</p>
