<p>I recently went to sunny Iceland, almost 24 hours sunlight is quite weird. Rather than staying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavik</a> for the whole week we rented a car and <a href="http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/travel/18ring.html">road tripped</a> around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_1_(Iceland)">ring road</a>, staying in campsites. If you ever go to Iceland I recommend doing this, you get to see so much more without having to worry about getting back to your hotel each night (camping during the winter though may be a bit cold). And how often can you say you've camped at the foot of a <a href="http://www.nat.is/travelguideeng/skaftafell.htm">Glacier</a>?</p>
<p>Below is a photo I took of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strokkur">Strokkur Geyser</a>, which is next to the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geysir">Geysir</a>.</p>
