The latest version of <a href="http://www.sigames.com/fm/">Football Manager 2006</a> was<br />
released recently. I picked up my copy yesterday and installed it on my 1.7ghz 512mb<br />
Tecra M4 tablet. I was expecting the game to run slow but this wasn't the case, a<br />
new game was set up within minutes which used to take alot longer on previous versions.<br />
However as I am only a few months into the season the database is still quite small,<br />
once I've played a lot longer I expect I will need to invest in some more RAM or move<br />
gaming over to Goofy (desktop pc).</p>

FM2006 (Championship Manager) is a <a href="http://www.esure.com/">Mr. Mouse</a> game,<br />
no keyboard required except if you are using the search box. This makes it perfect<br />
for you in tablet slate mode. All that is needed is for sigames to tablet enable the<br />
game to make the search functionality work. The tactics screen could also be revamped,<br />
being able to draw the tactics for players with ink (Andy Gray style) could be great<br />
if done well.</p>

Im sure alot of games on the market could benefit from inking ability</p>
