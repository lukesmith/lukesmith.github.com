I'm really liking dasBlog, it's amazingly easy to configure compared to Community<br />
Server and the themes are excellent. Took me a while but I decided on Project84.</p>
<p>
Thanks to some <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MigratingContentFromRandomBlogsToDasBlog.aspx">code</a> posted<br />
by ScottH porting my previous posts from CS was ridiculously easy. All thats needed<br />
is to get hold of my old posts on <a href="www.thespoke.net">theSpoke</a> and every<br />
post I've made will all be under one roof.</p>
