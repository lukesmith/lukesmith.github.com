I'm working with <a href="http://local.live.com/">Virtual Earth 3D</a> at the moment<br />
and noticed IE7 can go upto 400mb Memory Usage. I've discovered how to make it drop<br />
to a nice reasonable memory footprint...simply minimize IE and all the memory gets<br />
freed up to a nicer and much smallerÂ number. Maximizing the window afterwards<br />
doesn't cause a sudden memory frenzy either.</p>
<p>
So if you're having problems with greedy VE3D just minimize and maximize.</p>
