<p>I received a huge package today full of new gadgets to play with.<br />
Imagine this situation: your sitting in your living room meer feet away<br />
from the light switch and its a tiny bit cold. Do you want to get up<br />
and turn on the lights, or dim them for that 'romantic' mood? Well now<br />
I can be ultra lazy and control it all from a small unit next to the<br />
sofa.</p>
<p>Using the power lines (X10), meaning you don't have to rewire your house,<br />
just simply plug in the modules to a plug socket then plug the lamp or<br />
appliance into this module.</p>
<p>Theres a whole load of modules out there to help automate your home<br />
ranging from motion detectors and radio frequency transmitters to<br />
lamp/light fittings and cameras.</p>
<p>Now I just need to wait for the usb to serial adapter and then I can control it all<br />
from my PC.</p>
