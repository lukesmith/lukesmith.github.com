You are gifted with the natural fluency of a writer and the visual and spatial strengths<br />
of an artist. Those skills contribute to your creative and expressive mind.<strong> Insightful<br />
linguists</strong> can take complex concepts and articulate them to just about anyone.<br />
You have a gift with words and an insight into processes and the way people think.</p>
<p>These talents enable you to explain things clearly to people as you can <strong>conceptualise<br />
ideas internally</strong> and understand patterns on an <strong>abstract level</strong>.</p>
<p>
Whether these IQ tests are accurate who knows, but it's all fun.</p>
