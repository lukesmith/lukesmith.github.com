Well my tablet is. I just found a cool little <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/cicorias/archive/2006/11/22/97855.aspx">temperature<br />
monitor</a> and decided to give it a whirl on my tablet running Vista....65 degrees<br />
C, 114 F. Looking back at the look of temperatures the highest its been was 78 C.<br />
I'm not looking forward to the summer :s</p>
