I'm currently at the <a href="http://www.google.com/events/developerday/details.html">Google<br />
Developer Day</a>, in the bloggers lounge. Got my swag bag with some goodies in, including<br />
some <a href="http://www.puttyworld.com/">thinking putty</a>!</p>
<p>
My sessions for the day are New Features in the Map API, Google Earth and GeoWeb,<br />
Google Gadgets and From Mashup to Business.</p>
<p>
Should be a good day. I will have a comparison of who serves the best biscuits....Microsoft<br />
(who has awesomeÂ biscuits) and Google.</p>
