Although not out in the UK officially, i got myself a <a href="http://www.expansys.com/p.aspx?i=139791">Toshiba<br />
Gigabeat S</a> from <a href="http://www.expansys.com/">expansys uk</a>. They seem<br />
to be the only place this side of the pond to sell them.</p>
<p>
It's an awesome device, the screen is beautiful, the interface is easy to use and<br />
find what you want...and when you get bored of 60gb worth of music or video it's got<br />
an FM Tuner so you can jam out to the crap which they play.</p>
<p>
Music quality is brilliant, and sound quality on video is top notch for such a small<br />
device. The only downside is it can't play avi (divx, xvid) videos, WMP11 does however<br />
happily convert divx to wmv during the sync process but the quality of the picture makes<br />
it barely watchable. I'm going to have to play around with converting avi's to<br />
wmv outside of WMP (I've seen <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> can do<br />
it) and see how well it looks then (WMP will always convert video to a resolution<br />
suitable for the player, even WMV's). Videos from <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">channel9</a> look<br />
excellent when played back, all i need is to get non native wmv's to look that good,<br />
and their length makes it perfect for my train journey to and from work.</p>
<p>
It's a million times smaller than my old <a href="http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=210&amp;subcategory=211&amp;product=9882">Creative<br />
Zen PMC</a>, has 3 times the capacity but around half less battery on music and around<br />
2-3 times less battery for video as well as a smaller screen. But for Â£100 less its<br />
a great device.</p>
