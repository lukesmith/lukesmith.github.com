I decided to install <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> under <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx">Virtual<br />
PC 2007</a> but ran into problems straight away, the graphics screwup and the mouse<br />
doesn't work. A quick Google and I found a blog post about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikekol/archive/2007/08/06/making-ubuntu-7-04-work-under-virtual-pc-2007.aspx">making<br />
Ubuntu 7.04 work under VPC</a>. Followed the steps and all works fine now. Not sure<br />
what I'm going to do with it yet though.</p>
