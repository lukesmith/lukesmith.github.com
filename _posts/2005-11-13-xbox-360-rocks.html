I was in town yesterday and HMV and Game both had XBOX 360 gaming booths. Once i kicked<br />
the 5year old girl off (by that I mean stood patiently while she did nothing) I loaded<br />
up <a href="http://games.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1138/Call-of-Duty-2/">Call of Duty<br />
2</a> and proceeded to be amazed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
First thing I noticed was some of the graphics needed to be fine tuned, but a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=136078#136078">reply</a> to<br />
my channel9 thread post said that Anti Aliasing is turned of in the Pre-Release demos<br />
- so that should sort the rough edges out. The smoke and fire effects were amazing,<br />
and it certainly rivalled Half-Life 2 running on the PC with full graphics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Games on the current generation consoles, XBOX and PS2, are looking alot better than<br />
they did a few years ago. I got the latest <a href="http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2/651220p1.html">WWE<br />
Smackdown vs Raw 2006 </a>game on PS2, which has superb graphics compared to the games<br />
in the series 2years ago. Once developers get a handle on the next gen consoles things<br />
will get alot more exciting.</p>
