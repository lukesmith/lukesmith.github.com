<p>I've had my tablet (PLUTO) for a few months now and only just installed the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnanchor/html/tabletpc.asp">Tablet<br />
PC SDK</a>. Got an idea of a project I want to do, first I'll play around and see<br />
how difficult it will be, but PORN could be resurected. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=50" /></p>
