My O2 XDA Exec arrived yesterday in what can only be described as one of the funkiest<br />
boxes ever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The device is similar in size to the XDA II overall and a tiny bit heavier. The screen<br />
is amazing, looking back at the older model its like going back to 800*600 from 1024*768<br />
on a pc.</p>

Windows Mobile 5.0 is alot better than 2003, the introduction of the Smartphone buttons<br />
are welcome. However the games arn't consistent with how they use these, solitaire<br />
has the game options on the right button and the bubble breaker on the left - a small<br />
thing but worth a moan about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The keypad is cool, taking a while to get use to where the keys are though and I keep<br />
hitting the wrong buttons occassionally as a result.</p>

Answering Alex' question about PC Sync, you do get a usb sync cable but no cradle.<br />
I don't know why O2 advertise it as having no PC Sync on the website.</p>
