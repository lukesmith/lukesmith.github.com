<p>If you're a long term blog reader of mine then you'd know I have one of those pointlessly cool WiFi <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com">Nabaztag</a> rabbits. It usually just sits on my shelf doing nothing, but I've now decided to use it as a podcast player. I created a simple and quick IE Extension to be able to send links (the rabbit will only play mp3's) to the <a href="http://api.nabaztag.com/docs/home.html">Nabaztag Api</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a Nabaztag and you too want to send URLs from IE to be played on your pointlessly cool rabbit as well then follow the instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and extract the <a href="http://files.lukesmith.net/SendToNabaztagIEExtension.zip">SendToNabaztagIEExtension</a> zip to somewhere on your machine. </li>
<li>Right click on IEExtension.reg and select edit. </li>
<li>Modify the directory of IEExtension.html and save. </li>
<li>Double click IEExtension.reg to install the registry settings. (note: usual blurb about the dangers of editing the registry) </li>
<li>Edit IEExtension.html and enter the token and serial number for your rabbit. These can be found under the "my Burrow" section of the Nabaztag website. </li>
<li>Close any instances of IE. </li>
</ol>
<p>Next time you open IE, when right clicking on a hyperlink you will see an option 'Send to Nabaztag'. Clicking this will send the link to your bunny (note: the url is sent regardless of whether the rabbit can actually play it).</p>

<p>Notes: A new window is opened to make the request, which will show the response from the NabaztagApi. I tried using XmlHttpRequest but was unable to because of the cross-domain call being made. It was only quickly put together, so use at your own risk!</p>
