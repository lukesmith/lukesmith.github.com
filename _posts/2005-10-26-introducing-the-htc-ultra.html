Well its not announced but what features should be included in the HTC Universal++?<br />
I think built in GPS and biometric reader should be included, these are already in<br />
some Pocket PCs so should be making their way into the PocketPC Phones at some point<br />
down the line.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
What else would be cool? WiMax support, internal HDD. I really hope they don't ever<br />
bring passive tablet screens to the pocket pc line, its useful being able to use your<br />
fingers instead of getting the stylus.</p>
