I just upgraded to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx">Windows<br />
Media Player 11</a>, however first annoyance is it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/webhelp/default.aspx?&amp;mpver=11.0.5721.5145&amp;id=C00D118E&amp;contextid=232&amp;originalid=C00D118E">won't<br />
sync</a> with my XDA Exec. It looks like i've got to wait for o2 to get off their<br />
asses and release a firmware update.</p>
<p>
*Edit: I spoke to soon. Closing WMP11 and reopening it clears any problems.</p>
