<p>Tonight down at <a href="http://www.greenpark.co.uk/">Green Park</a> in Reading lots<br />
of rich blokes/blokettes are getting the first look at their new car, the Austin Martin<br />
Vantage, which they apparently paid for in full 3 years ago without seeing the car.<br />
It's a nice looking car but I prefer the Vanquish, which was on display outside. I<br />
should have taken a pic of the Vantage and released it to the web, could have been<br />
my big blogging scoop. doh!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=47" /></p>
