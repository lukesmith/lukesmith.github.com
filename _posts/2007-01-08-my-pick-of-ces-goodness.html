I'm shattered, I stayed up like a good geek and watched Bill Gates CES (Consumer Electronics<br />
Show) Keynote. The keynote being at 6:30pm Pacific time making it 2:30am my time.</p>
<p>
A few cool things I can't wait for from the keynote:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://windowsultimate.com/">Windows Ultimate Extras</a> - well mainly just<br />
the one makes me go 'ooo' and I like things which make me go 'ooo'. Windows <a href="http://windowsultimate.com/blogs/extras/archive/2007/01/07/windows-dreamscene.aspx">DreamScene</a> allows<br />
you to play a high-def video (mpeg or wmv) as your desktop background. During<br />
the keynote the background was a pretty high def image of a waterfall. Then the presenter<br />
enabled <a href="http://www.mstechtoday.com/2007/01/07/windows-desktop-motion-now-windows-dreamscene/">DreamScene</a> and<br />
the background came to life with flowing water 'ooo'. It will probably look a<br />
bit poopy with your own videos as you will see the loop but Microsoft is shipping<br />
it with looping videos. Now it is kind of a bit pointless, but none the less don't<br />
let that take anything away from the coolness. Watch the <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/larry/windows-vista-ultimate-extras/">on10</a> video<br />
with info on all the Extras.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/whs_preview.asp">Windows Home Server</a> -<br />
This excites me more than the 'ooo' above, mainly because it has a very practical<br />
use. I've just ran out of storage on Goofy (my desktop pc) including the 260GB external<br />
HDD so I'm going to need more storage (I was going to build a file server with Server<br />
2003 but can't afford it quite yet). Well Microsoft has the answer to home users who<br />
have more than one PC and wishes to easily manage all of their media (pictures, videos,<br />
music, files) allowing access over the internet via a friendly URL. As well as backing<br />
up your whole computer (thats every bit on the HDD). <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/jesse/windows-home-server-will-live-in-your-closet-simplify-your-life/">on10</a> video<br />
of WHS.</li>
<li>
IPTV coming to the Xbox360 - Record and watch TV on your Xbox360. Chat to friends<br />
while watching tv using Xbox Live, or record shows while your playing online. <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/tina/you-heard-it-people-carbon-is-real/">on10</a> video</li>
</ul>
<p>
Go watch the <a href="http://microsoftatces.com/archive/2007/01/07/2007-international-ces-keynote.aspx">keynote</a>.</p>
<p>
Other cool things I've seen on <a href="http://ces.engadget.com/">engadget</a> and <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/">gizmodo</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
A <a href="http://ces.engadget.com/2005/09/09/hp-to-bring-wifi-enabled-lcd-tvs-to-market-in-2006/">HDTV<br />
that has a Windows Media Extender</a> allowing you to extend Windows Media Center<br />
without another box in your living room. But you might as well get a Xbox360.</li>
<li>
My next phone? I love my HTC Universal and now it's successor, <a href="http://feeds.engadget.com/~r/weblogsinc/engadget/~3/72498376/">HTC<br />
Omni</a> is announced.</li>
</ul>
<p>
My bank balance is looking a little low for all the new stuff I <strike>want</strike> need.</p>
