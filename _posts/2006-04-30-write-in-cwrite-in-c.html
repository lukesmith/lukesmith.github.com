I've not surfed the net for random stuff in years, but came across one <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2005/06/16/geek_songs_not_the_monday_competition.html">geektastic</a> song.</p>

 Let It Be<br />
   <br />
<br />
    When I find my code in tons of trouble,<br />
    Friends and colleagues come to me,<br />
    Speaking words of wisdom:<br />
    "Write in C."<br />
   <br />
<br />
    As the deadline fast approaches,<br />
    And bugs are all that I can see,<br />
    Somewhere, someone whispers:<br />
    "Write in C."<br />
   <br />
<br />
    Write in C, Write in C,<br />
    Write in C, oh, Write in C.<br />
    LOGO's dead and buried,<br />
    Write in C.<br />
   <br />
<br />
    I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,<br />
    For science it worked flawlessly.<br />
    Try using it for graphics!<br />
    Write in C.<br />
   <br />
<br />
    If you've just spent nearly 30 hours<br />
    Debugging some assembly,<br />
    Soon you will be glad to<br />
    Write in C.</p>
