Now that I'm running Vista RTM on my tablet I thought I'd look at what gadgets are<br />
available for the sidebar.</p>
<p>
I found 2 cool gadgets; one is a <a href="http://cener.co.uk/files/folders/gadgets/entry327.aspx">BBC<br />
Radio gadget</a> which allows you to select which BBC radio station to listen to,<br />
the <a href="http://cener.co.uk/files/folders/gadgets/entry343.aspx">second</a> connects<br />
to <a href="http://get.live.com/messenger/features">Windows Live Messenger</a> and<br />
lists all your online (or offline) contacts and allows you to open a new chat.</p>
<p>
Vista RTM is a huge improvement over previous release candidates. I'm currently running<br />
with 512mb RAM and its ok, I would recommend 1gb tho.</p>
