Some <a href="http://www.thehotfix.net/">nice people</a> have made a comparison list<br />
of all the Vista Editions, listing only which features an edition doesn't have.</p>
<p>
Hardware Configuration(s)-Acceptability:<br />
1: Max. ram support: 4GB for 32-bit systems. [Across all versions]<br />
For 64-bit: 8GB max. for basic, 16GB max. for premium and more than 128GB for business<br />
and ultimate. (Maximum tested at the Microsoft Labs was 128GB, and more could be accepted.)<br />
2: Duo-processors support: Unavailable in Basic and Premium.<br />
3: Integrated Smart card management: Not supported in both Prenium and Basic.<br />
4: Control over installation of devices: Not supported in both Premium and Basic.<br />
5: Virtual PC Express: Unsupported in all versions, except Ultimate.</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
So if you've just splashed out on, or looking to splash out on a Duo processor make<br />
sure you budget for upgrading to Ultimate at some point, but then again who wouldn't<br />
want Ultimate to begin with? :)</p>
