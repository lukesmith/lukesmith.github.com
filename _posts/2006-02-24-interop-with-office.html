I'm currently playing around with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/office/">Office</a> PIA<br />
COM components to do some spreadsheet work. Trying to dynamically generate Excel Workbooks<br />
isn't easy, so I created my own xml structure for describing the layout of a worksheet.<br />
My libarary includes a very handy ExcelTable object which allows you to bind a datasource<br />
to be generated.</p>
<p>
One of the many annoying this about the Excel COM component is the ColorIndex property.<br />
Finally I've found a <a href="http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/excel/colors.htm">website</a> which<br />
documents the ColorIndex numbers with their associated color.</p>
