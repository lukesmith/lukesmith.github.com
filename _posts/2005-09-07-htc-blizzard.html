One thing which everyone says to me is "Why do you have a brick as your phone?", obviously<br />
actually thinking that I'm trying to compensate for something. I was never a fan of<br />
the original MS Smartphones, mainly because they lacked asphetically pleasing design.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The Pocket PC with phone functionality won it for me; the tried and tested PPC form<br />
factor with added telephony capability. Now HTC (boy have they been busy lately) have<br />
a new product, the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000893057745/">HTC Blizzard</a>.<br />
It runs the MS Pocket PC OS, not the Smartphone OS. This brings the ability for adding<br />
touch screen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
If you've been wanting a Pocket PC Phone but without the bulkyness then this is something<br />
worth looking at. I don't think my pockets would handle a Blizzard + Universal, nor<br />
would I need them both. Good thing I don't have my Creative ZEN PMC anymore/for now<br />
