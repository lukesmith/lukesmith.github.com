Among some of the great features within Windows Vista; Super Fetch, WPF, etc one of<br />
the most exciting in my opinion are these things called <a href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/">Microsoft<br />
Gadgets</a>. I know konfabulator has existed for a while and Apple has widgets on<br />
OS X Tiger but Windows Gadgets are alot more than little floaty things on your desktop/sidebar.<br />
They can be displayed on <a href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/sideshow.aspx">external</a> peripherals;<br />
a keyboard, a secondary screen on a mobile device giving access to cached data such<br />
as emails and calender appointments when the device is switched off. If the device<br />
is switched on you can do alot more, a media player without having to have your laptop<br />
open :)</p>

All I need now is Windows Vista so I can play around with them</p>
