You may have noticed my <a href="http://www.sportsdo.net/">SportsDo</a> Activities<br />
have now been merged into my RSS feed (so you can see when i decide to do some exercise).<br />
As I was using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> to abstract my<br />
blogs RSS feed it won't affect any of my hordes of readers.</p>
<p>
I used <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a> to merge two RSS feeds (my<br />
blogs feed and my activity feed from the SportsDo portal) and then sort them descending<br />
by pubDate. I then pointed FeedBurner at the feed Yahoo then exposes.</p>
<p>
Yahoo pipes is a great tool if you have multiple RSS feeds you want merged into one.</p>
