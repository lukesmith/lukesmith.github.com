They are full of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/07/dell-google-may-do-1-billion-bundling-deal/">crap</a>.<br />
When I buy a PC I don't want it to come bundled with x-amount of crapÂ I'm going<br />
to have to spend time to uninstall, I want a fresh clean system. If you must give<br />
me the software give it on an extra CD so I can choose if I want it installed myself.</p>
<p>
I was lucky, originally when I brought my TabletPC I was expecting lots of preinstalled<br />
'extras' included, as I'd read about from people who'd brought it in the states, but<br />
none was included.</p>
