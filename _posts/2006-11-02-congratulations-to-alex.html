Just a quick congratulations to <a href="http://alexpreston.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!AFF137440DD19C3D!1789.entry">Alex</a> whose<br />
got himself a new job (Alex lives in a small city call NYC). It's a good reason to<br />
keep up with the development community, he found the job via the <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">dotnetrocks</a> podcast.</p>
