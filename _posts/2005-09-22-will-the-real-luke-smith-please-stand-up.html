suggestion kitty, such a clever little cat, has posted about recruiters using the<br />
interweb to find 'secret' information about interviewees which they don't put on their<br />
CV. So in response I would like the world to know the following about me, incase you<br />
muddle me up with any of the other Luke Smiths in the world.</p>
