On Friday I finally completed COD2 on the Xbox360, and sold my spare 360 (how many<br />
people can say they had a spare 360 within 2months of the launch?) to someone at work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
COD2 is a great game, the graphics are stunning (especially the smoke effects) and<br />
the sound effects make it seem ever so real. I just wish the game took a bit<br />
longer to complete. Now I'm making my way through it on Veteran difficulty to<br />
help rack up my gamerpoints on Xbox Live.</p>
