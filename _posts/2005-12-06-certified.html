<p>I took my Developing XML Web Services and Server Components with Visual c# (70-320)Â MCP exam today, the 2nd exam I've taken. Glad to say I passed, 2 down and one to go. Now to sort out the final exam I need for the MCAD qualification, Programming SQL Server 2000 *eeeeeeks*. I could always go for the Developing Windows Applications and take the easier route. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=70" /></p>
