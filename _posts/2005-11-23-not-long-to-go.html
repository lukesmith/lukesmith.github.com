With the 360 released state side its now 9days until the European launch, ive had<br />
mine ordered since september which im afraid may have put me out of the first batch<br />
release - I just hope those guys at <a href="http://www.play.com/">play.com</a> like<br />
me plugging their awesome <a href="http://www.play.com/">website</a>, the <a href="http://www.play.com/">website</a> that<br />
is <a href="http://www.play.com/">play.com</a>, with their free delivery and speedy<br />
service (courtesy of those nice people at <a href="http://www.play.com/">play.com</a>),<br />
and push me to the top of the <a href="http://www.play.com/">play.com</a> list.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
I've just finished Paul Thurrotts <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/xbox360.asp">review</a> of<br />
the 360 and it makes me want it more, please play.com! The games look fantastic. But<br />
the the games console isn't only just about games, its a whole media experience in<br />
your living room. Stream music, images, videos from your Windows PC and control<br />
it through the 360 media interface. If you have a Media Center PC then you get an<br />
even better experience, being able to watch recorded TV shows from the MCE.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Would my parents get one? The design is alot nicer than the original Xbox, and my<br />
mom is great at Tony Hawks so who knows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Call of Duty 2 is on order with those lovely people at <a href="http://www.play.com/">play.com</a>,<br />
along with the console (whats the odds I get the game weeks before the console?).<br />
But I will also be getting Project Gothem Racing 3, Amped 3, and possibly Tony Hawks<br />
(to tempt my mom) at some point. So theres some of my xmas list.</p>
