<p>Thanks to <a href="http://scottisafool.spaces.live.com/">Scott</a> for making me do this :@</p>
<p><strong>1. How old were you when you started programming?</strong></p>
<p>I started messing about with Q Basic back when I was about 14 but never wrote anything 'proper' until I started college at 16.</p>
<p><strong>2. How did you get started in programming?</strong></p>
<p>My dad was one of those bedroom coders when I as little (he actually wrote a cool piece of software that was in use for over 10 years and saw life on the ZX-Spectrum, Amiga and PC). I picked up one of his books and had the intention of writing something cool....it ended up just being 'hello world!'.</p>
<p><strong>3. What was your first language?</strong></p>
<p>Q Basic, followed by Pascal at college and Delphi. I messed around with HTML and made a few dodgy websites that I think still exist to this day somewhere. [edited - <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~smith99/rct/homepage.htm">Luke's RCT Site</a>]</p>
<p><strong>4. What was the first real program that you wrote?</strong></p>
<p>My A' Level coursework, a friend of mine had a virtual airline (Microsoft flight simulator geekiness) and he wanted a program to manage his pilots ours and generate html reports for his website. What took me months in Delphi I could now knock together in a matter of days. Oh yea I didn't use a database either, stored everything in random access files....ergh!</p>
<p><strong>5. What languages have you used since you started programming?</strong></p>
<p>HTML, JavaScript, C, Java, C#, ASP,C++,TCL (I loved that), T-SQL,Basic,Pascal,O-Caml, Matlab, XML,Delphi</p>
<p><strong>6. What was your first programming gig?</strong></p>
<p>I freelanced when I was about 16 doing HTML for some company who'd designed the website. I did everything with tables,yuck.</p>
<p><strong>7. If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?</strong></p>
<p>Yea. Its fun when you have a challenge. Though I still hate T-SQL...I love you LINQ.</p>
<p><strong>8. If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://scottisafool.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!FABDDDC5CAD93494!33612.entry">Scott has said</a> Google (and soon <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>) is your friend.</p>
