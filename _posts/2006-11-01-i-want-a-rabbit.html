I just found this <a href="http://new.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">awesomely pointless<br />
product</a>, so awesomely pointless infact I want one. It's a little rabbit which<br />
connects via WiFi to the intraweb which can then have messages sent to it from friends,<br />
notify you of the weather (because you can't always look outside), read websites to<br />
you. Theres even a <a href="http://blog.nabaztag.com/2006/09/api_nabazlab_an.html">development<br />
environment for windows</a>, and a Cruise Control plugin (the ears notify you whether<br />
a build has been built successfully).</p>
<p>
I want one for no apparent reason other than its pointless and totally cool. And at<br />
only <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Communicating-Rabbit-WiFi-54Mb-information/dp/B000FDEC0G/ref=sr_11_1/202-7296196-7918226?ie=UTF8">Â£65</a> it's<br />
not a bad price.</p>
