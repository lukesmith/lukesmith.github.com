This is one of the most <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">amazing pieces<br />
of technology</a> I've seen in a while. On a recent trip to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukesmith/sets/72157594276854493/">Brugge</a> I<br />
had photosynth in the back of my mind and so I was taking photos in a way that they<br />
would look cool when I'd finally get my hands on it. Unfortunately the tech preview<br />
still doesn't allow you to use your own photo sets.</p>
