<font size="2" face="Arial">For anyone<br />
out there who doesn’t know about Windows Vista, or for those who know about<br />
it and don’t see a reason why they should upgrade other than getting an all<br />
new fancy UI then this <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1931913,00.asp">article</a> is<br />
a read well worth its time.<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial"><br />
 <br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">A couple<br />
of things to point out from the article:<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">New power<br />
management (Sleep mode – similar to hibernation but much quicker to load from)<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">SuperFetch<br />
– Windows learns what applications and OS bits you use most often and preloads<br />
them into memory, which even differentiates which applications you use at different<br />
times of day and days of week.<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">New Driver<br />
Model – ever get annoyed with having to reboot after installing a new driver?<br />
Well now drivers are run in User level instead of the kernel level. This should also<br />
stop your system crashing when a driver fails<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Networking<br />
– The networking stack has been rebuilt, with IPV6 built directly in and improved<br />
security and speed. An improved</p>
<p>Networking<br />
Center</p>
<p></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Media</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><br />
Center<br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> –<br />
Included in the Home Premium and Ultimate SKU<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">New Audio<br />
Stack – Now runs in user mode, not kernel mode bringing improved stability.<br />
Improved quality, now based on 32bit floating point instead of 16bit integer. More<br />
control over audio settings (per application audio)<br />
Direct X10 – won’t be back ported to XP<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">New built<br />
in apps – Windows Mail, Windows Calender, Photo Gallery<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">New UI –<br />
its not all fancy for no reason. Now if an application is busy or hangs and you move<br />
it, the application underneath won’t be a big white mess. The UI scales to your<br />
resolution. New designed start menu<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Improved<br />
Search – System wide search, similar to spotlight on Mac OSX Tiger, ‘only<br />
the Windows version searches a much greater variety of files, more metadata, and searches<br />
within more types of files’.<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Sidebar<br />
– A very cool application for hosting gadgets. Similar to Konfabulator (and<br />
OS’X’s Widgets)<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Improved<br />
Security – users by default run with fewer privileges. BitLocker to encrypt<br />
full drives and account information incase your machine gets pinched.<br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial"><br />
 <br />
</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Arial">I only picked<br />
out on a few things from the <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1931913,00.asp">article</a>.<br />
Go read it for more in depth details.<br />
