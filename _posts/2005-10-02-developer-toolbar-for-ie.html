I came across this great tool for web developers, a little late since it was released<br />
at the PDC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<em>With the IE Dev Toolbar you have several features at your fingertips to go deep<br />
into existing pages or pages that you are currently creating. You will be able to<br />
explore the DOM tree and find elements on the page, disable IE settings, view information,<br />
outline elements, control images, resize pages to common screen resolutions and have<br />
a powerful ruler that lets you measure pixel perfect content on your page. It also<br />
will help you to validate against existing standards and provides pointers to W3C<br />
specs. </em></p>
