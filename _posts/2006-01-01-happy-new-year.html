A breif recap of my 2005</p>
<p>
In january I suffered a hangover as a result of celebrating 2004. July I<br />
<br />
graduated with a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in Computer Science and Cybernetics, started my<br />
<br />
first proper job. August I celebrated becoming 21! September I ordered my Xbox<br />
<br />
360...Decemeber I didn't receive my Xbox 360.</p>
<p>
Im sure lots of other interesting things happened over the course of the year<br />
<br />
but i'm in the January stage already for 2006.</p>
<p>
Happy new year</p>
