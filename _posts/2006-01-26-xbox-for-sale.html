Not my limited edition green one after all I horde my old stuff but instead I have<br />
a lovely brand new Xbox360 up for grabs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
After waiting an eternity, nicely snuggled into a more managable time period of just<br />
under 2months, I got my hands on not one but 2 360s! On wednesday I tried <a href="http://shop.game.net">Game</a> to<br />
see if they had any and signed up in the queue being told I should get one by the<br />
end of the week. Thursday morning they phoned me to let me know I could collect, why<br />
didn't I go in there sooner? I checked online at lunch and the <a href="http://www.play.com">play.com</a> order<br />
was still 'awaiting stock' so covering my bases, incase the God of Xbox360 decided<br />
it wasn't my turn to get one from Game that day, I thought I'd cancel the play order<br />
once I had one in my hands. But the God of Xbox360 was feeling generous yesterday<br />
and decided I should now be allowed my play order, which removes that magical orange<br />
'Cancel' button and puts a nice message saying 'packing'.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
So now I have 2 Xbox360 premiums with the HDD and wireless controller, plus a big<br />
credit card statement. Oh well payday and bonus next week</p>
