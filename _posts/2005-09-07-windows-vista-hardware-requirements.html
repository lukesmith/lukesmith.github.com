APC Magazine has an <a href="http://www.apcstart.com/teched/pivot/entry.php?id=6">article</a> about<br />
the 'Hefty hardware requirements for Windows Vista'. ...Vista would work best on a<br />
video card with more than 256MB RAM, 2GB of DDR3 memory and a S-ATA 2 hard drive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
These are 'optimal performance' requirements. Vista beta 1 currently runs fine on<br />
1gb (even as low as 512mb), 2.2ghz with 256mb GPU. Now that may sound alot, especially<br />
the GPU but remember Vista isn't out for another 12-15 months.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
When i brought my 256mb 9600xp GPU 18months ago I paid Â£230. I recently brought another<br />
one for my spare machine for Â£40. I know more and more people who have upgraded their<br />
machines already to 1gb of RAM.</p>
