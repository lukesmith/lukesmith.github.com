Hanselman</a> hasÂ written an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/someassemblyrequired/lookatme/">article</a> on<br />

be able to make use of this for his final year project; something to do with making<br />
sounds from differing colored blocks.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=44" /></p>
