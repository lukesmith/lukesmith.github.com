I'm looking for a web based newsgroup reader, so no matter what computer I'm on I<br />
have access to what I've marked as interest and what I've replied to. Currently I'm<br />
using <a href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=6ac2bed2-b5a4-4a0a-a897-e36dd191a9f4">Windows<br />
Live Mail Desktop</a>, I have used MS Outlook in the past and a <a href="http://www.mapilab.com/outlook/nntp/">NNTP<br />
plugin for Office Outlook</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google groups</a> works great with the one exception,<br />
if I post something then my email address gets exposed to the WWW and I can't seem<br />
to find a way to edit it so add the usual 'NOSPAM' text, which I'm sure is a pointless<br />
effort as spammers probably parse the addresses to remove this. I just made the mistake<br />
of posting something thru google groups and it will probably increase the spam to<br />
my inbox now.</p>
<p>
Microsoft has an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx">online<br />
reader</a> for their newsgroups but its slow and crap.</p>
