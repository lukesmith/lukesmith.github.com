Yesterday was the 2nd <a href="http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/default.asp">Developer<br />
Developer Developer Day</a> resulting in a few drinks down Vodka Revolutions followed<br />
by a geek dinner down at Zizzi's.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
There were alot of interesting talks throughout the day; James Crowley's talk on AJAX<br />
in ASP.NET was great. The WPF (Avalon) was cool, great speakers can really<br />
make a presentation stand out from the rest. I missed a few talks I was hoping to<br />
see, the bluetooth for mobile devices and Attacking Windows and Web Applications (really<br />
gutted I missed this one).</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The next time I goto TVP I hope im supplied Jelly Babies and Jelly desert :)</p>
<p></p>

A big thanks to all those who organised the event and to <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/waterbaby/">Sarah</a> who<br />
organised the meal afterwards. It's a shame the food took hours to arrive at the tables<br />
but a good time was had geeking it up, I even got podcasted briefly. It's weird how<br />
small the (geek) world is, a few people recognised my name and I was sat with a guy<br />
who <a href="http://www.digitalmythic.com/">Mike Bright</a> used to work with.</p>
