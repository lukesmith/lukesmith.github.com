My local football club <a href="http://www.swindontownfc.premiumtv.co.uk/">Swindon<br />
Town FC </a>(soccer for you rich American people) is crap basically, we've lost<br />
8 games in a row and are bottom of the league. It was only two years ago that<br />
we were in the playoffs - we have potential we just need your love (money).</p>
<p></p>
<p>
So I'm asking a rich person to buy the club, shove loads of cash in and help make<br />
us great again (we beat Arsenal back in 1969!! and even Juventus!).</p>
