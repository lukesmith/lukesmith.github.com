<p>At the TechEd conference Microsoft have shown whats to come in <a href="http://www.apcstart.com/teched/pivot/entry.php?id=5">Windows<br />
Vista Beta2</a>. It's looking good, I like the new alt+tab view. Though without trying<br />
it out I'm not too sure how the Windows 'expose' functionality will feel to use. Expose<br />
is great (yes mark, rachel and monkey boy it's great), I use the <a href="http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk/">topdesk</a> application<br />
which brings similar functionality to windows (it's a memory whore if your screensaver<br />
kicks in though).<img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=8" /></p>
