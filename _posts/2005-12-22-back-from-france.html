I lie, I've been back since saturday I just havn't got around to blogging.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
We go on holiday to get away from the depressingness that work is but then end up<br />
feeling worse when we have to actually go back to work after an excellent holiday,<br />
it sucks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The snow was great, with the exception of the second to last day, and as with last<br />
year it snowed on the last day. The ski commitee got everyone to by a santa outfit<br />
for the last day, I don't think Val Thorens had seen over 200 santa clauses before<br />
in one place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The view from the top of the mountain was fantastic.<br />

With christmas coming up I thought I'd buy myself a nice present, so being fed up<br />
of the uncomfy and well worn ski boots you hire I splashed out on some really comfy<br />
boots. Compared to renting them, when its 'here you go, if your feet fit in them you<br />
take them' buying a pair is completely different. I spent about 30minutes trying on<br />
numerous pairs before deciding on this pair (modelled by the lovely me).<br />
