A friend of mine Nick is off galavanting around the world with his misses. I've been<br />
following his and Kams adventures via his <a href="http://www.surfthegecko.com/blog/blog.htm">blog</a> (currently<br />
they are in Bangkok). I tried getting him to set up a <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> account<br />
(mainly because I'm lazy and I like everything delivered to me via rss, which his<br />
gallery doesn't provide).</p>
<p>
Anyway this blog is mainly for my mum, since I'm sure she'd like to keep track of<br />
his adventures. So mum fire up <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">IE7</a> and<br />
grab nicks <a href="http://www.surfthegecko.com/blog/atom.xml">rss</a> (not arse!)<br />
into the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx#ie7rss">IE7 feed<br />
store</a></p>
