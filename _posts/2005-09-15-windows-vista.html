The Windows Vista <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/experience.mspx">website</a> has<br />
been updated. Lot's of information about the next OS to come out of Redmond. All I<br />
can say is I want it now, not in a year!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
One feature that is really cool is that you can add <a href="http://bink.nu/Article4840.bink">USB<br />
memory keys </a>to the machine and Windows Vista will add this memory to the systems<br />
virtual memory, all part of whats called SuperFetch.</p>
