...or Opera becomes free.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
We all knew this would <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2005/10/opera-quadruples-download-rate.htm">happen</a>,<br />
well I did. Now that the <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> browser is free<br />
Opera is reporting that they've had a large number of new users download the browser<br />
(3million) - or is that people who already paid top dollar for it downloading it again?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
This should put a big pie filled smirk on my Mikes face.</p>
