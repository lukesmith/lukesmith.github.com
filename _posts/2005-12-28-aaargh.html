<p>I'm being attacked by comment spam so be warned if you run across any adult links in the comments. I think I need to upgrade from .text to communityserver, which has some protection against posting multiple comments <img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=75" /></p>
