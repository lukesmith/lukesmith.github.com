I've spent part of the day slowly moving my blog over to <a href="http://communityserver.org">communityserver</a>.<br />
It's been a pain in the ass, and I still need to copy another 30posts from .text over<br />
to it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
I was getting alot of comment spam over the past few days and am hoping the features<br />
in <a href="http://communityserver.org">communityserver</a> will help weed it out<br />
before its visible to the world, and so stopping search engines indexing it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
One problem I've had so far is with <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a>,<br />
i'm running into problems when trying to claim the blog but I've submitted a support<br />
request from them so hopefully it should be sorted soon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
I've had to do a few hacks to get the new blog working with my subdomainÂ (the<br />
blog can still be accessed via <a href="http://blog.lukesmith.net">http://blog.lukesmith.net</a>)<br />
and I've had to add a new rss file on my server to redirect automatically to the <a href="/comserver2/blogs/lukesmith/rss.aspx">new<br />
rss url</a>, so hopefully you won't have to update your Feed Aggregator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
I hope it won't be too hard to migrate over to the final version of CommunityServer<br />
2.0 when its released from the beta I'm currently running.</p>
