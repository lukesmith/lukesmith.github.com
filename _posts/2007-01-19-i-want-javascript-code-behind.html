<p>
ASP.NET provides a great feature, code behind files, where the high level language<br />
(C#/VB.NET) can sit in a separate file to the UI markup of the page.</p>
<p>
But what about Javascript? Well you create a javascript file and shove it in a folder,<br />
I tend to use /scripts, and then add a script include reference to it, or put the<br />
javascript within the HTML page. The problem with putting it in an external file<br />
is you can't use &lt;%= control.UniqueID %&gt; to get the ID of a control<br />
on that page after its rendered (you would have to 'hardcode' that id). If the javascript<br />
is with the HTML you can use &lt;% %&gt; as ASP.NET parses it and puts the proper<br />
ID in place.</p>
<p>
Solution? Well what I'd like to see is a javascript code behind, mypage.aspx.js just<br />
as with a cs code behind. The js file gets automagically included when the page is<br />
requested and the javascript file is parsed for &lt;% %&gt; and voila. You get the<br />
caching benefits and maintable code that having an external javascript file gives.</p>
<p>
UserControls could use the same approach and add the javascript include to the page.</p>
<p>
In debug="false" mode ASP.NET could optimize the javascript too to remove comments<br />
and un needed formatting reducing the file size.</p>
<p>
Any thoughts?</p>
