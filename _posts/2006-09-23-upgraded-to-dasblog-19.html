<p>
I just upgraded to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasblogce">dasBlog 1.9</a>,<br />
Scott Hanselman has a list of all the new <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/25454995/DasBlog19Released.aspx">features</a> over<br />
on his blog. It took ages to do, but thats not due to dasBlog. Making a backup of<br />
the existing files on my webserver to my tablet took hours.</p>
<p>
All seems to be running fine tho, I will need to make the few changes I had made adding<br />
my xbox gamercard and skype links in.</p>
