I've just been playing around with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle">Microsoft's<br />
Sandcastle CTP</a>, a replacement for NDoc (RIP). No matter whose batch script I used, <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mikaels/archive/category/2813.aspx">Sandcastle<br />
Helper</a>, Sandcastle Batch, I kept getting the same error message which was stopping<br />
the generation of the chm.</p>
<p>
HHC6000: Error: An internal file could not be created. Make certain there is enough<br />
disk space on the drive where you are compiling your file.<br />
<br />
HHC5007: Error: Fatal navigational compilation error. This is likely the result of<br />
an invalid contents (.hhc) file.</p>
<p>
But I finally came across <a href="http://www.inchl.nl/SandcastleGUI/">SandcastleGUI</a> which<br />
works great, and is simpler to use than editing a batch script.</p>
