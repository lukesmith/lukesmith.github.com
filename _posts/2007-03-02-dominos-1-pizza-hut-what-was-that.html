I don't hang up the phone on people often, but after 10 attempts to tell the Pizza<br />
Hut women my phone number I had to give in.</p>
<p>
It took less time to order from dominos than it did to get past stage 1 of ordering<br />
from Pizza Hut.</p>

Dominos 1 - 0 Pizza Hut</p>

Now I have to walk down the road and collect :(</p>
