This is my token post, I'll feel left out if I don't make it, to say that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/">Windows<br />
Vista</a> has been RTM (Released To Manufacturing).</p>
<p>
I had a rant last night to <a href="http://elgg.sse.rdg.ac.uk/siu03pjs/weblog">Philip</a> about<br />
how I was annoyed at having my rss reader flooded with the same story...Vista RTM<br />
(i think i must have seen it mentioned some 100 times, adding to that <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/blogs/news_and_announcements/archive/2006/11/06/.NET-Framework-3.0-has-been-released_2100_.aspx">.NET<br />
3.0 RTM</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/nov06/11-062007OfficeRTMPR.mspx">Office<br />
2007 RTM</a> my head is all RTM'd out).</p>
<p>
I may have to suggest to <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">newsgator</a>/<a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=FeedDemon">feeddemon</a> to<br />
add some form of grouping ability of similar posts tho they have likely thought of<br />
it already.</p>
