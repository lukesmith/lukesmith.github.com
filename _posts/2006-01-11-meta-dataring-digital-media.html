<p>With my collection of digital images growing steadily I was thinking how I could manage them all when I came across the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/imaging/starteredition.mspx">Microsoft<br />
Digital Image Starter Edition 2006</a> download (free-trial which loses features after<br />
60days). I'm liking this application, good interface and ease of use.</p>
<p>I was then pointed to <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> by<br />
Dave (got a blog dave?), which from my limited play around time and<br />
knowledge of editing images was equally as good (and free). However I'm<br />
after adding the meta data to the images; Photographer name, Labels etc<br />
which Picasa is not quite as good at. It doesn't read the labels I'd<br />
added to the files from within MDISE 2006 - so no good for me.</p>
<p>Why add all these meta data? Well with Vista out soon, and by soon I<br />
mean 'hopefully' this year, I want to be able to easily find any<br />
pictures and video clips from holiday easily from within the new Vista<br />
search features. Type in Dereks name and all pictures with Derek in<br />
will be found, type in Val Thorens and my Val Thorens ski pictures will<br />
instantly be shown.</p>
<p>For now though <a href="http://desktop.msn.com/">MSN Desktop Search</a> does this,<br />
but not as powerful as Vista will be.</p>
