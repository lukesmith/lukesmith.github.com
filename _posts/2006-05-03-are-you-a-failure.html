An interesting <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000576.html">post</a> on<br />
why failing is good. I can think of a few times when I've failed and I learnt from<br />
these. One being to take my notes to open book exams, that really helps, and the other<br />
is to not drink too much alchohol the night before an exam. But besides from the comical<br />
failures I've suffered I've worked on projects where things havn't gone according<br />
to plan, and not worked out how I had hoped. I've always tried to not let these happen<br />
to me again in later projects and changed how I approach certain problems. Failing<br />
is always good, you do learn alot more from seeing what you can't do than what<br />
you can do.</p>
<p>
So is failing to fail counted as a failure?</p>
