<p>On a previous <a href="http://blog.lukesmith.net/posts/150.aspx">post</a> I mentioned<br />
that I used a piece of software called <a href="http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk/">TopDesk</a> to<br />
bring expose like features to Windows XP. Unfortunately I was running an old version<br />
of the software, which was why I was having a problem with it eating large amounts<br />
of memory when the screensaver kicked in. James Stewart from OtakuSoftware left a<br />
comment directing me to download the latest version where it had been fixed. That's<br />
what I call good support. Cheers James.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://dasblog.lukesmith.net/aggbug.ashx?id=21" /></p>
