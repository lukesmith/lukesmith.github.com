Last night me and <a href="http://tinnes.org.uk/">Tom</a> spent several hours downloading<br />
some HD content from <a href="www.wmvhd.com">wmvhd.com</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=abde1e02-b529-469e-ae6a-7417fcde9e12&amp;displaylang=en">Xbox360<br />
High Definition trailers</a> from the Microsoft website. The color in the pictures<br />
is absolutely stunning, if you have a HDTV definitely download the IMAX trailers and<br />
if you have a good enough spec PC give them ago but it still doesn't come close to<br />
actually viewing them on a widescreen HD Ready tv.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
However since we were running these videos from the spare PC in the living room (1.4ghz,<br />
512mb RAM, 256mb 9600gpu) some trailers were very jerky and couldn't be viewed. This<br />
meant every 720p (even the 480p were jerky) movie trailer we tried from <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers">Apple</a>,<br />
which annoyingly is the only place we could find which has High Definition movie trailers<br />
to download, was unwatchable due to this jerkyness - with Quicktime eating up 99%<br />
of processing. At some point we're going to move one of our more powerful PCs down<br />
to the living room to see if this fixes the problem.</p>

I've ordered myself a copy of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/content_provider/film/T2DVD.aspx">T2:<br />
Extreme DVD</a> from the states, it's region 1 DVD but the 2nd disc contains a copy<br />
of the movie in WMV9 Series in HD. Annoyingly tho its DRMd and who knows whether its<br />
viewable outside of the states but if its not <img src="http://blog.abaxus.net/Images/emotions/smiley-smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile" /></p>
