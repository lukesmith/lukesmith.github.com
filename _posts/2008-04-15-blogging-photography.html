<p>I was reading over on the <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/blog/blog-power-why-you-should-consider-setting-up-a-photoblog/">Digital Photography School blog</a> about blogging your photos. Well I have a blog, and I've recently started taking photos with a <a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/eos400d/">Canon 400D DSLR</a> I bought last year (thanks to the tax man who over taxed me years ago and me for finally asking for it back), but I haven't really merged the two. I upload photos to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukesmith">flickr</a> account, but don't link to them from my blog. Until now...let's hope I keep it up.</p>
<p>Heres a photo of the sun setting in front of the main stage at <a href="http://www.readingfestival.co.uk">Reading Festival</a> in 2007 (not with my DSLR). I remember getting quite burnt that year.</p>
