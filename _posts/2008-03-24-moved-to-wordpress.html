<p>It's Easter Monday and I've been a bit bored (having just got back from an awesome weeks skiing in Meribel, France). I've decided to move away from the Dasblog blog engine to Wordpress. I'm very impressed so far. It's very plugginable, and the default theme is by far better than what I previously had (for those who don't register to my RSS feed).</p>
