It's not everyday that you find a bug in a piece of Microsoft code, but <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1290644&amp;SiteID=1">2<br />
bugs</a> in one day? And those 2 bugs being in the same function? Well I should have<br />
played the lottery this week.</p>
<p>
In the <a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/sdk">Virtual Earth API</a> the VEPushpin.Dipose<br />
function contains 2 bugs, which are caused through carelessness more than anything<br />
else (we all make them).</p>
<p>
The LOC is:</p>
<p>
<em>VEPushpin.prototype.Dispose=function(){this.DetailsStyle==null; this.TitleStyle=null;this.IconStyle=null;this.Details=null;this.IconUrl=null;this.Title=null;this.LatLong=null;this.ID=null;this.m_vemapcontrol=null;this.m_vemap=null</em></p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Taking a quick glance and only one is obvious.</p>
<p>
Instead of setting the <em>this.DetailsStyle</em> variable to null, a boolean comparison<br />
is being performed. When the method is meant to set everything to null what you don't<br />
expect is somethings to not be nulled.</p>
<p>
The second bug is <em>this.IconUrl</em>. Now this could be '100% correct' within this<br />
function as it has the naming convention of the Virtual Earth API. But when the rest<br />
of the VEPusphin object appears to use Iconurl as the variable then its a bug. Iconurl<br />
doesn't get nulled, and a new object variable gets created called IconUrl and set<br />
to null. I love javascripts <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2006/11/25/a-taxonomy-of-typing-systems/">strong<br />
typing</a> (or lack of).</p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>
Still after finding these bugs and creating my a workaround fix it hasn't fixed the<br />
memory leak that's occuring.</p>
